                                    with a laid-back attitude about everything, even with achieving my goal of becoming Shaman King. 
                                    Because i was alienated by everyone outside of the family he instead chose to bond with spirits and has decided that anyone who can see spirits cannot be evil.
                                    He has even gotten a signature catchphrase: "everything will work out" as a way of seeing things.
